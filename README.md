#Fish Academy Repo
Welcome to the Fish Academy GitHub repo! This repo is home to the code and exercises for the in-house course offered by December Labs, where I'll learn all about HTML and CSS.

###Exercise 1: Simple Box Grid
For the first exercise, we had to create a simple box grid based on a sample image. This exercise will help us practice using CSS to create layout and structure on a webpage.

To get started, we had to review the sample image provided and use HTML and CSS to create a grid of boxes that matches the layout. You can find the sample image and solution in the "ex1" folder in this repo.
